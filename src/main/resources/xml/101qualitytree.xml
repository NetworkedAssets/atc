    <h4>Content</h4>
    <p>The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.</p>

    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.</p>

    <h4>Form</h4>
    <p>The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>tree-like refinement of the term “quality”. Use “quality” or “usefulness” as a root</li>
        <li>a mind map with quality categories as main branches</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.</p>
