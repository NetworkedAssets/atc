      <p>The quality tree ( as defined in ATAM - Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Methode) with quality / evaluation scenarios as leafs.</p>
      <h6>Motivation</h6>
      <p>When you want to evaluate the quality (especially risks to certain quality attributes) with methods like ATAM, you need to systematically refine your quality goals (from <ac:link>
          <ri:page ri:content-title="1.2 Quality Goals"/>
        </ac:link>). The quality tree shows the top-down refinement of the stakeholder-specific notion of quality.</p>
      <h6>Form</h6>
      <p>We personally prefer mind maps to a pure tree-like structure, as mind maps allow arbitrary cross-references between scenarios, attributes and intermediate nodes.</p>
      <p>Often it is difficult to assign scenarios to single quality attributes, as the scenario refers to several qualities at once. Simply draw references from such scenarios to all affected nodes!</p>
