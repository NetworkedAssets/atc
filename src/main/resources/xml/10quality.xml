      <p>This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios.
          The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)</p>

      <p>Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
          which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.</p>

      <h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
      <p>Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
          decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
          concrete and measurable.</p>
