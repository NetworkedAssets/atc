      <h4>Motivation</h4>
      <p>From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.</p>

      <h4>Form</h4>
      <p>Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format. If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.</p>
      <p>Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.</p>
