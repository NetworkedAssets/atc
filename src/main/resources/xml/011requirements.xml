      <h6>Contents</h6>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>·What happens in the system’s environment?</li>

      <h6>Motivation</h6>
      <p>From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to improve execution of a business activity.</p>
      <p >This essential architecture driver must not be neglected even though the quality of an architecture is mostly judged by its level of fulfillment of non-functional requirements.</p>
      <h6>Form</h6>
      <p>Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.</p>
      <p>The business context should in any case refer to the corresponding requirements documents.</p>
      <h6>Examples</h6>
      <p>Short descriptions of the most important:</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>business processes</li>
        <li>functional requirements</li>
        <li>non-functional requirements and other constraints (the most important ones must be covered as architecture goals or are listed in the “Constraints” section), and/or</li>
        <li>quantity structures</li>
        <li>background information</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Here you can reuse parts of the requirements documents – but keep these excerpts short and balance readability against avoidance of redundancy</p>
