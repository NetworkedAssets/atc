      <p>Short description of the functional requirements.</p>
      <p>Digest (or abstract) of the requirements documents.</p>
      <p>Reference to complete requirements documents (incl. version identification and location).</p>
     
      <h4>Contents</h4>
      <p>A compact summary of the functional environment of the system. Answers the following questions (at least approximately):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What happens in the system’s environment?</li>
        <li>Why should the system exist? Why is the system valuable or important? Which problems does the system solve?</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Motivation</h4>
      <p>From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to improve execution of a business activity.</p>
      <p >This essential architecture driver must not be neglected even though the quality of an architecture is mostly judged by its level of fulfillment of non-functional requirements.</p>
     
      <h4>Form</h4>
      <p>Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.</p>
      <p>The business context should in any case refer to the corresponding requirements documents.</p>
     
      <h4>Examples</h4>
      <p>Short descriptions of the most important:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>business processes</li>
        <li>functional requirements</li>
        <li>non-functional requirements and other constraints (the most important ones must be covered as architecture goals or are listed in the “Constraints” section), and/or</li>
        <li>quantity structures</li>
        <li>background information</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Here you can reuse parts of the requirements documents – but keep these excerpts short and balance readability against avoidance of redundancy</p>
