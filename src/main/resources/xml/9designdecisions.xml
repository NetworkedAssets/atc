      <p>Document all important design decisions and their reasons!</p>
      <h6>Motivation</h6>
      <p>It is advantageous if all important design decisions can be found in one place. It is up to you to decide if a decision should be documented here or rather locally (e.g. in the white box descriptions of building blocks). In any case avoid redundancies.</p>
      <h6>Form</h6>
      <p>Informal list, if possible ordered by the decisionsâ€™ importance for the reader.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, use the following template to structure your decisions:</p>
      <h6>9.x.1    Problem</h6>
      <div style="margin-left: 30.0px;">
        <p>What exactly is the problem?</p>
        <p>Why is it relevant for the architecture?</p>
        <p>What consequences does the decision have?</p>
      </div>
      <h6>9.x.2    Constraints</h6>
      <div style="margin-left: 30.0px;">
        <p>Which constraints do you have to keep in mind?</p>
        <p>What factors influence the decision?</p>
      </div>
      <h6>9.x.3    Assumptions</h6>
      <div style="margin-left: 30.0px;">
        <p>Which assumption have you made?</p>
        <p>How can you check those assumptions?</p>

      </div>
      <h6>9.x.4    Considered Alternatives</h6>
      <div style="margin-left: 30.0px;">
        <p>Which alternative options did you consider?</p>
        <p>How do you judge each one?</p>
        <p>Which alternatives are you excluding deliberately?</p>
      </div>
      <h6>9.x.5    Decision</h6>
      <div style="margin-left: 30.0px;">
        <p>Who (if not you) has decided?</p>
