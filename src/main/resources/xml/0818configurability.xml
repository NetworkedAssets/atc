      <p>The flexibility of a software system is influenced by its configurability, i.e. the possibility to make certain decisions about usage of the system at a late point in time.</p>
      <p>Configurability can occur at the following events:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>During development: For example server, file, or directory names could be stored directly in the code (“hard-coded”).</li>
        <li>During deployment or installation: Configuration information for a specific installation (such as the installation path) can be given.</li>
        <li>At system startup: Information can be read dynamically before or during system startup.</li>
        <li>During application execution: Configuration information is queried or read during runtime.</li>
      </ul>
