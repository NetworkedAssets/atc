                <p>Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.</p>
                <p>You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description. Please prefer
                    relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, compelx or volatile building blocks. Leave out normal, simple,
                    boring or standardized parts of your system.
