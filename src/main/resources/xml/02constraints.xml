                <h4>Content</h4>
                <p>Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the
                    development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.
                </p>

                <h4>Motivation</h4>
                <p>Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints. Constraints
                    must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.
                </p>

                <h4>Form</h4>
                <p>Simple tables of constraints with explanations. If needed you can subdivide them into technical constraints, organizational and
                    political constraints and conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)
                </p>
