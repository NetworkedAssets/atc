      <h4>Contents</h4>
      <p>Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design decisions or the development process.</p>
      
      <h4>Motivation</h4>
      <p>Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.</p>
      <p>Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.</p>
      
      <h4>Form</h4>
      <p>Informal lists, structured by the sub-sections of this section.</p>
      
      <h4>Examples</h4>
      <p>see sub-sections</p>
      
      <h4>Background Information</h4>
      <p>In the optimal case constraints are defined by requirements. In any case, at least the architects must be aware of constraints.</p>
      <p>The influence of constraints is described by [Hofmeister et al] (Software Architecture, A Practical Guide, Addison Wesley 1999)  using the term “global analysis”.</p>
