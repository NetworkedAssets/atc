      <p>Scenarios describe a system’s reaction to a stimulus in a certain situation. They thus characterize the interaction between stakeholders and the system. Scenarios operationalize quality criteria and turn them into measurable quantities.</p>
      <p>Two scenarios are relevant for most software architects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.</li>
        <li>Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you design safety critical systems a third type of scenarios is important for you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Boundary or stress scenarios describe how the system reacts to exceptional conditions. Examples: How does the system react to a complete power outage, a serious hardware failure, etc.</li>
      </ul>
        <p>Scenarios comprise the following major parts (according to [Starke05], original structure from [Bass+03]):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stimulus: Describes a specific interaction between the (stimulating) stakeholder and the system. Example: A user calls a functions, a developer implements an extension, an administrator installs or configures the system.</li>
          <li>Source of the stimulus: Describes where the stimulus comes from. Examples: internal or external, user, operator, attacker, manager.</li>
          <li>Environment: Describes the system’s state at the time of arrival of the stimulus. This should list all preconditions that are necessary for comprehension of the scenario. Examples: Is the system under normal or maximal load? Is the data base available or down? Are any users online?</li>
          <li>System artifact: Describes the part of the system is affected by the stimulus. Examples: The whole system, the data base, the web server.</li>
          <li>System response: Describes the system’s reaction to the stimulus as determined by the architecture. Examples: Is the function called by the user executed. How long does the developer need for implementation? Which parts of the system are affected by the installation / configuration?</li>
          <li>Response measure: Describes how the response can be measured or evaluated. Examples: Downtime in hours, correctness yes/no, time for code change in person days, reaction time in seconds.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>You need scenarios for the evaluation and review of architectures. They take the role of a “benchmark” and aid in measuring the architecture’s achievement of its objectives regarding the non-functional requirements and quality attributes.</p>
        
        <h4>Form</h4>
        <p>Tabular or free text. Explicitly highlight the scenario’s elements (source, environment, artifact, response, measure).</p>
        <p>Alternatively, use similar notations as those suggested in <ac:link>
            <ri:page ri:content-title="6. Runtime View"/>
          </ac:link>
        </p>
        
        <h4>Background Information</h4>
        <p>There are relations between scenarios and the runtime view. Often you can use scenarios of the runtime view fully or as a basis for evaluation. Evaluation scenarios additionally contain response measures that are often not considered in the pure execution focus of runtime scenarios.</p>
