      <h4>Content</h4>
      <p>Concretizaion of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.</p>

      <p>These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.</p>

      <p>For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.</li>
          <li>Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Motivation</h4>
      <p>Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.</p>

      <p>Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2) more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.</p>

      <h4>Form</h4>
      <p>Tabular or free form text.</p>
