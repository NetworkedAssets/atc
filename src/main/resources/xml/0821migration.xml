      <p>In many cases a new software system is intended to replace an existing legacy system. As an architect you should not only consider your shiny new architecture but also all organizational and technical aspects that must be considered for the introduction or migration of the architecture.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Concept, process, or tools for data transfer and initial data creation.</li>
        <li>Concept for system introduction or temporary parallel operations of legacy system and new system.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Is it necessary to migrate existing data? How do you execute any needed syntactic or semantic transformations?</p>
