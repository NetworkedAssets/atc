      <h4>Motivation</h4>
      <p>The following sections describe recurring or generic structures and dependencies among any set of building blocks – possibly even across different levels.</p>
      <p>We call a dependency or structure <em>generic </em>if it appears more than once in the architecture.</p>
      <p>An example is the structure of getting data out of a relational database via the model or application-layer up to the graphical views - which will quite often be implemented using the same structures and patterns throughout the application, regardless of the concrete data (class, domain-entity) involved.</p>
      
      <h4>Form</h4>
      <p>Use building block models (class diagrams, package diagrams, component diagrams, etc.) and related descriptions in the same way as in the hierarchical decomposition.</p>
      <p>Often it is practical to support understandability by adding specific runtime views to these recurring structures.</p>
